## Overview

### What This Application Does

Number Background Generator is a small application that allows you to display
a user-input number with a random font, random background color, and random
foreground color.

### Why This Application was Created

When I was studying Russian, I needed to learn the numbers. I wanted a memorable
way to remember all the numbers. Typing them on the back side of Anki flash
cards was not optimal. So I created this application to make the learning and
reviewing process more pleasant and enjoyable.

## Technologies

This application was created using Java SE 19 with WindowBuilder.

## Limitations

This application has not been converted to an executable file yet.

## Future Plans

I simply want to do the following:

1. Add an icon to this application.

2. Publish this application as a download-able, executable file so that
non developers can use it.

After that, I have no plans to develop this application. I simply want to
perform these tasks to show that I can.
